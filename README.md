This repository has some test OpenCV code that should help teach CV during quarantine.

It is currently just a couple of python scripts, but it may expand in the future.

## Application Example

## How to run application

To run, make sure no other application is using you webcam.

Before running, make sure to install opencv by running `pip install opencv-python`

Then, it git bash run `./run.sh` in the project directory.

If this does not work, go into the `./src/` folder and run:

- `python ./main.py`
- `python3 ./main.py`
- `py ./main.py`

Try all of these as one may work and others will not/
